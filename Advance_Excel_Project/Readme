BANK LOAN REPORT



#OBJECTIVE

The goal of this report is to provide an in-depth analysis of our bank's lending performance, highlighting key metrics to drive data-based decisions. By examining various loan-related KPIs and tracking changes over time, we can better understand the health of our loan portfolio and fine-tune our lending strategies.







DASHBOARD 1: SUMMARY



To effectively assess the bank's loan performance, the following KPIs should be included:



1. Total Loan Applications: Track the total number of loan applications received within a specific period. This includes Month-to-Date (MTD) Loan Applications and a Month-over-Month (MoM) comparison.

   

2. Total Funded Amount: Monitor the overall amount disbursed in loans, with an emphasis on MTD totals and MoM variations.



3. Total Amount Received: Measure the total repayments received from borrowers, analyzing MTD values and MoM changes to assess cash flow.



4. Average Interest Rate: Calculate the average interest rate across all loans, observing both MTD and MoM shifts for deeper cost analysis.



5. Average Debt-to-Income (DTI) Ratio: Determine the average DTI of borrowers to evaluate financial stability, including MoM fluctuations and MTD comparisons.







KPI Segmentation: Good Loans vs. Bad Loans



We need to differentiate between 'Good Loans' and 'Bad Loans' to better understand the performance of our loan portfolio.



Good Loan KPIs:

Good Loan Application Percentage: The percentage of applications that fall under 'Good Loans' (loans that are 'Fully Paid' or 'Current').

Good Loan Applications: The total number of 'Good Loan' applications.

Good Loan Funded Amount: The total amount disbursed for 'Good Loans.'

Good Loan Total Received Amount: Total repayments made on 'Good Loans.'



Bad Loan KPIs:

Bad Loan Application Percentage: The percentage of applications classified as 'Bad Loans' (loans that are 'Charged Off').

Bad Loan Applications: The total number of applications under the 'Bad Loan' category.

Bad Loan Funded Amount: Total disbursements for 'Bad Loans.'

Bad Loan Total Received Amount: Total repayments from 'Bad Loans.'







Loan Status Grid View



A comprehensive grid view report categorizing loans by 'Loan Status' will allow us to evaluate core metrics like 'Total Loan Applications,' 'Total Funded Amount,' 'Total Amount Received,' and MTD comparisons for various categories. This view will help us gain quick insights into our loan portfolio's health across different statuses.
